                New Leash on Life is the result of a collaborative effort between two leading animal welfare groups, 
                the Humane Society of the United States and Maddieâ€™s Fund, and the leading producer of public service
                advertising (PSA) campaigns, The Ad Council. <br> <br>
                Our goal is to make shelters the first place potential 
                adopters turn when looking to get a new pet, ensuring that all healthy and treatable pets find loving
                homes. We do this by breaking down misconceptions surrounding shelter pets and celebrating the unique
                bond between every shelter pet and parent.
